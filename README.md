About the App
Madat is a all in platform where common people like me and you can help those in need.Be it simple tasks like tutoring students to finding employers to lifesaving tasks like transporting people to hospitals Madat has it all.


Technical Aspects
Madat is made using .NET 4.7.2 (so using it may require installation of VS19).It makes use of Microsoft SQL Server as a database(local database).
We have also used Nuget packages like Material Skin Theme as well as Circular Progress Bar Package.

Improvements that can be done
Instead of using a localized database we can make a database that can be accessible to all also various other databases can be used like MongoDB, MySQL etc. Initially we wanted to implement the maps API to show the location of available volunteers but couldn't do it because of  time constraint as well as the Google Maps API was paid.Also the functionality of uploading the notes can be explored.
